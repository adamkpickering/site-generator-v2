<p>I often find myself convinced that one side of an argument is true,
but without the points that brought me to that frame of mind within easy grasp.

and that is what many of these pages are.
Others are ideas I have that may or may not be reasonable.
Getting them down gets them out of my head.
Perhaps you can benefit from reading these.
I certainly do from writing them.</p>
