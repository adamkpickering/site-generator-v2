# Welcome!

I'm an engineer-in-training from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
This site is a place for me to put ideas.

Don't know where to start?
Try looking below at Navigation - hopefully the links are self-evident.
Or, head on over to my [github](http://github.com/adamkpickering/) to see what I've
been working on.
